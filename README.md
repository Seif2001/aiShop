# 🤖 AI Customer Service Agent

This project is a full-stack conversational AI agent designed to assist users with customer service tasks such as:

- 📦 Tracking orders
- 👤 Managing user profiles
- 🔍 Searching products

It uses **Django REST Framework** for the backend and **React + Vite + TailwindCSS** for the frontend. Authentication is managed using **JWT tokens**, and AI replies are generated through a custom Python agent.
